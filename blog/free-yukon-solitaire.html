          / Free Yukon Solitaire
        </h1>

        <p>
          In March, I released my seventh game: <a href="/yukon/">Yukon
          Solitaire</a>. It's a rather complex solitaire that become easy to
          play with some practice. Yukon is a close cousin of Klondike
          Solitaire, so it wasn't difficult for me to create this game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like all Solitaire-Play games, Yukon use a single deck of 52 playing
          cards. The layout of the game is similar to Klondike, except you have
          to deal all cards at the start, leaving no deck or stock.
        </p>

        <p>
          After shuffling the deck, deal 28 cards the same way as Klondike to
          make a tableau with seven stacks. The first stack get one face up
          card, the second get 2 cards (one face down and one face up), the
          third get 3 cards (two face down and one face up). The seventh pile
          ends with 7 cards : 6 face down and the last face up. Deal the
          remaining 24 cards face up onto columns 2 to 7, by adding 4 cards to
          each one.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like most solitaires, the object of Yukon is to move all the cards
          from the tableau onto four foundations (the four stack at the top of
          the screen). You start foundations with an ace upon which the suits
          will build in sequence, from ace to king.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          Les coups possibles : construire fondation, déplacer d'une pile à
          l'autre du tableau, si possible pour libérer des cartes...
        </p>

        <p>
          ...
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/yukon-2.png" title="Yukon: free stack" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          ...
        </p>

        <p>
          When there is no more possible move, the game is over. Sometimes,
          there are available moves, and in fact you end up in a loop. Thus the
          game is over too... But if you succeed to build all cards from ace to
          king in foundations, you win! You should win about 1 in 4 games. Note
          that with concentration and practice the best players are known to win
          about 75% of the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yukon is a great variation to the classic Klondike Solitaire. If you
          like playing Klondike, you will probably enjoy Yukon Solitaire. It's a
          very challenging and addictive game. You need to play a lot to learn
          some basic strategy and increase your skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Solitaire-Play games come with undos, hints and automatic moves. And
          you can play <a href="/yukon/">Yukon Solitaire</a> for free on
          desktop, tablet and phone...
